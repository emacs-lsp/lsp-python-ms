=lsp-mode= client leveraging Microsoft's [[https://github.com/Microsoft/python-language-server][python-language-server]].

* Installation

Include ~lsp-python-ms~ in the configuration file:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; (setq lsp-python-ms-prefer-pyls nil)
(require 'lsp-python-ms)
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook #'lsp) ; or lsp-deferred
#+END_SRC

A minimal ~use-package~ initialization might be:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package lsp-python-ms
    :ensure t
    ;; :init (setq lsp-python-ms-prefer-pyls nil)
    :hook (python-mode . (lambda ()
                            (require 'lsp-python-ms)
                            (lsp))))  ; or lsp-deferred
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
For now, the pyls is the default lsp client (priority of lsp-python-ms is set to -2), If you prefer lsp-python-ms, please set =lsp-python-ms-prefer-pyls= to =nil=.
#+END_QUOTE

Normally the [[https://github.com/Microsoft/python-language-server][python-language-server]] will be downloaded automatically if it doesn't
exist while opening the python scripts.

If you have troubles to download the package, you can also build the server yourselves.

1. Install [[https://www.microsoft.com/net/download][dotnet-sdk]]
2. Clone and build [[https://github.com/Microsoft/python-language-server][python-language-server]]:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/python-language-server.git
   cd python-language-server/src/LanguageServer/Impl
   dotnet publish -c Release -r osx-x64   # mac
   #+END_SRC

   Change the ~-r~ flag according to your architecture and operating system.
   See Microsoft's [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog][Runtime ID Catalog]] for the right value for your system.

   Then make the binary executable.
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   chmod a+x $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/output/bin/Release/osx-x64/publish/Microsoft.Python.LanguageServer
   #+END_SRC

   NOTE: on some systems (for example, Fedora), the executable comes out as
         ~Microsoft.Python.LanguageServer.LanguageServer~.

3. Set executable to ~lsp-python-ms-executable~.

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   ;; for executable of language server, if it's not symlinked on your PATH
   (setq lsp-python-ms-executable
         "~/python-language-server/output/bin/Release/osx-x64/publish/Microsoft.Python.LanguageServer")
   #+END_SRC

For development, you might find it useful to run =cask install=.

* FAQ

1. Unresolved import warnings

   Add the directories to =lsp-python-ms-extra-paths= or =PYTHONPATH=. Refer to [[https://github.com/microsoft/python-language-server/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#unresolved-import-warnings][Troubleshooting - Unresolved import warnings]].

2. Autocompletion doesn't work

   The folder may have huge folders and files, and  the server takes a long time to index them. So please DO NOT put huge files in the project/workspace folder.
