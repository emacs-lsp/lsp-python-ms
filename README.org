=lsp-mode= client leveraging microsoft's [[https://github.com/Microsoft/python-language-server][python-language-server]]

* Installation
Include ~lsp-python-ms~ in the configuration file:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require lsp-python-ms)
(add-hook 'python-mode #'lsp) ; or lsp-deferred
#+END_SRC

A minimal ~use-package~ initialization might be:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package lsp-python-ms
    :ensure t
    :demand
    :hook (python-mode . lsp))  ; or lsp-deferred
#+END_SRC

For development, you might find it useful to run =cask install=.
